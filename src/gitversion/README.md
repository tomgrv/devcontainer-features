# Gitversion Feature

This feature installs [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/), a tool to help you generate a version number based on your git history.

Originally, GitVersion was designed to be used in a CI/CD pipeline. However, it can also be used in a dev container to calculate the version number of the application.

More information about GitVersion can be found on the [GitVersion GitHub page](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion).

"features": {
    "ghcr.io/tomgrv/devcontainer-features/gitversion:1": {

    }
}
```

## Options
